# Terminal Tetris implementation plan

## Requirements and approach

Build a terminal Tetris game in this target, launched with `npm start`. Keep the entire display—including board, borders, score, controls, and game-over text—within 24 terminal rows in every state. Do not commit from the implementation agent; the factory commits changes.

Use a testable game model separate from terminal I/O. Use a conventional 10-column, 20-row playfield and all seven tetrominoes. A practical display budget is 22 rows for the bordered playfield and two status/control rows; replace existing status text for messages rather than appending rows. No particular rotation system, scoring formula, or dependency is mandated: choose simple deterministic rules and document them. Keep the automated test command available as `npm test` (reuse any existing tooling if present).

Every task below must produce a focused committable change in the target, including the automated checks described. Tasks remain unchecked until their changes have been committed.

- [x] 1. Deliver a runnable, bounded terminal board display.
  - Inspect the target and adapt existing project conventions rather than overwriting unrelated work. Configure `npm start` to render an empty 10×20 board with borders, score, and concise controls.
  - Extract rendering into a pure function and configure an automated test command.
  - Acceptance/automated checks: starting from the target succeeds; the rendered frame contains all 20 board rows, borders, score, and controls; counting visible rows (including handling trailing newlines) never exceeds 24. Capture output without needing an interactive terminal.

- [x] 2. Introduce tetromino definitions and initial piece generation.
  - Add all seven tetrominoes, initial board state, active-piece coordinates, and a random piece source that can be seeded or injected for tests. Spawn the initial piece in a valid centered position and render it distinctly from empty cells.
  - Acceptance/automated checks: each shape has exactly four distinct cells; every piece initially fits an empty board; deterministic generation exercises all seven types; active-piece rendering remains within the frame budget.

- [x] 3. Implement collision-safe horizontal movement.
  - Add left/right model actions with a shared placement/collision predicate. Keep settled cells and the active piece separate.
  - Acceptance/automated checks: unobstructed movement changes position by one column; walls and settled cells reject movement without changing state; repeat movement cannot escape either wall; an active piece does not collide with itself.

- [x] 4. Implement deterministic rotation.
  - Add clockwise rotation using a documented rule, with invalid rotations rejected (wall kicks are optional, not required). Handle the square piece consistently.
  - Acceptance/automated checks: legal rotation preserves four cells; a complete rotation cycle restores geometry; wall, floor, and settled-cell collisions cannot create overlap or out-of-bounds cells; rejected rotations preserve the original state.

- [x] 5. Implement downward movement without locking.
  - Add a one-row downward action that reports whether movement was blocked, without merging cells or spawning pieces. This primitive will support timed falling and soft drop.
  - Acceptance/automated checks: a legal step moves exactly one row; floor and settled cells block the step; repeated steps stop at the first obstruction and leave the board unchanged.

- [x] 6. Implement piece locking and next-piece progression.
  - Add a separate lock operation and a game action that locks when a downward attempt is blocked, then creates the next active piece. Keep blocked-spawn handling explicit for the later game-over task rather than allowing overlaps.
  - Acceptance/automated checks: locking copies exactly four cells into the board without altering unrelated cells; a successful downward move does not lock; a blocked move locks once and consumes exactly one next piece; the next piece is not advanced by the same action that spawned it.

- [x] 7. Implement completed-line clearing and board compaction.
  - Clear full rows after locking and before next-piece placement; return the number of cleared rows as an event/result for scoring.
  - Acceptance/automated checks: zero, one, two, three, and four simultaneous clears; nonadjacent full rows clear correctly; remaining rows retain their relative order; empty rows are inserted at the top; board dimensions stay 10×20. Include an end-to-end lock-that-completes-a-row case.

- [x] 8. Implement scoring and its display.
  - Choose and document a simple points table for cleared lines, initialize score to zero, and update score exactly once per lock/clear result. Render the live score in the reserved status area.
  - Acceptance/automated checks: verify each supported clear count, accumulation across multiple clears, and no points for ordinary movement, failed movement, rotation, or zero-line locks. Large scores must not add display rows.

- [x] 9. Implement game-over detection and restart.
  - Detect an obstructed next spawn after line clearing, transition to a game-over state without overwriting settled cells, and show the message in existing display rows. Add restart that creates a fresh playable state.
  - Acceptance/automated checks: blocked spawn ends the game; an unblocked spawn continues; a clear that opens spawn space is processed before the decision; movement/rotation/drop actions after game over do not mutate the board or score; restart resets board, score, active piece, and game-over status. Both running and game-over frames stay within 24 rows and expose the relevant controls.

- [x] 10. Add timed gravity and pause behavior.
  - Introduce a controllable scheduler that drives the existing downward/lock action at a documented fixed interval. Add pause/resume and display its state using the existing status rows.
  - Acceptance/automated checks with a fake clock: no fall before the interval; one expected action per tick; grounded pieces lock and progress; pause and game over stop advancement; resume/restart do not accumulate duplicate timers or catch-up falls; all displayed states remain bounded.

- [x] 11. Connect keyboard controls to the playable terminal session.
  - Wire left/right arrows, up-arrow rotation, down-arrow soft drop, pause/resume, restart after game over, and quit; advertise the actual bindings within the display. Process input without requiring Enter in an interactive terminal.
  - Keep input decoding testable and handle unknown keys safely. If an additional hard-drop control is offered, implement and test it explicitly rather than implying support.
  - Acceptance/automated checks: feed real key byte sequences through the input adapter and verify the corresponding model actions, including multiple keys in a chunk and arrow sequences split across chunks; unknown keys cause no state change; a scripted terminal session can move, rotate, descend, pause, resume, and restart. Controls and status still occupy no more than the allocated rows.

- [x] 12. Make terminal redraw and session teardown reliable.
  - Redraw in place instead of scrolling frames; manage raw mode, cursor visibility, input listeners, and timers for the session lifetime. Restore terminal state on quit, interruption, and handled failures. Define safe behavior for non-TTY input and terminals too small for the board, without crashing or printing an oversized frame.
  - Acceptance/automated checks with terminal/process fakes or a PTY: repeated frames replace rather than append; quit and interruption restore raw mode/cursor and remove listeners/timers; cleanup is idempotent; narrow/short-terminal warnings fit the available display; returning to a suitable size can render the bounded game frame; non-TTY startup exits or produces bounded output without hanging.

- [x] 13. Verify and document the complete launch-to-exit experience.
  - Add concise project documentation for installation, `npm start`, `npm test`, supported terminal size, bindings, scoring, rotation, and fixed gravity behavior.
  - Add an automated integration regression that launches the actual entry point with controlled terminal I/O, exercises falling, locking, a line clear and score update, game over, restart, and quit, and checks that every emitted frame stays within 24 rows.
  - Deliver a verification report in the target recording commands performed and results, including the complete automated suite and an interactive or PTY smoke test of the actual launch command. Record any limitations honestly and resolve requirement failures before declaring completion.
  - Acceptance: `npm test` passes; `npm start` starts the playable terminal game; all required information is visible without scrolling past 24 rows in running, paused, and game-over states; exit leaves the terminal usable.

## Completion rule

The plan is complete only when every task and subtask above has been delivered and committed, with no unchecked task remaining. Verification alone does not complete missing implementation work.
